# **Welcome to My Data Portfolio!**
Hello, Iâ€™m Eric de Souza Piasentin, a Data Scientist passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. With a strong background in machine learning, deep learning, geospatial analysis, and data visualization, I specialize in applying Python, SQL, Tableau, and GIS to solve real-world problems across multiple industries.

I have a Master of Science in Computer Science from Florida Atlantic University and completed MITâ€™s Applied Data Science Program, in March 2025, where Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in AI, ML, and recommendation systems. My work spans business analytics, finance, and marketing, leveraging data-driven strategies to optimize decision-making.
